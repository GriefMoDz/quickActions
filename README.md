2. Hover your cursor over the "Powercord" sub-menu.

## Frequently Asked Questions:
1. __Help, I'm using a supported plugin from the "[Compatibility Table](https://github.com/GriefMoDz/quickActions/#compatibility)" but I seem to be missing some settings. What do I do?__

   > ~~Due to how context menus are laid out, plugin settings are only limited to buttons, checkboxes (this includes switch items), and sliders. This means that text inputs are completely unavailable and left ignored until further notice.~~
   >
   > ~~You should still be able to quickly access the settings of a said plugin by simply selecting its corresponding sub-menu item, where you can find and edit all kinds of text to your hearts content. c:~~
   >
   > This plug-in is still heavily in beta, meaning that not all settings you see in the 'User Settings' menu will necessarily be found under the Powercord sub-menu. I'm trying my best and working around the clock to have them pushed out as soon as possible. Please be patient.
