## Frequently Asked Questions:
1. __Help, I'm using a supported plugin from the "[Compatibility Table](https://github.com/GriefMoDz/quickActions/#compatibility)" but I seem to be missing some settings. What do I do?__

   > Due to how context menus are laid out, plugin settings are only limited to buttons, checkboxes (this includes switch items), and sliders. This means that text inputs will be completely unavailable and left ignored for the duration of usage.
   >
   > However you still be able to quickly access the settings of said a plugin by simply selecting its corresponding sub-menu item, where can edit all kinds of text to your hearts content.
